This is a puzzle which requires a sequence of tasks to be completed before it can be opened. First a series of mathematical problems are to be solved to find the key to the combination lock.

Then once this is open, the corner can be opened up to reveal a gear which is then used inside the hole.

By twisting the gear, a rack and pinion transmission system pushes the cylinder on the side of the box. This reveals the contents inside the box.
