Using my 3D printer, I designed a CAD model of this puzzle which requires using rotational motion to open.
The locking mechanism is created by having 4 chambers each with a ball bearing inside.
The ball bearing can slide back and forth in this chamber.
When the ball is on one side of the chamber, it prevents the parts attached to the lid from opening.

To open the puzzle, one must spin the hexagon which makes each ball fly out towards the outside of its chamber thus moving away from its locked state. If done correctly, all four chambers will be unlocked and the lid can be opened.
