This 30 cm diameter wooden sphere was made by first gluing many layers of wood around 5 cm thick together to make one solid block. It was then spun on a wood lath and machined to create the spherical shape.

To open the cap, one must place the capâ€™s face against a magnetic object (e.g. a fridge).
This will allow the cap to overcome its own magnetic force which holds the cap inside the ball.
